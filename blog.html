          <h3 >CSS Positioning: An Introduction</h4>
          <h6 >October 17, 2014</h6>
          <h5>How does CSS Spacing work?</h5>
          <p class="blogP">The positioning property in CSS, not surprisingly, helps you position your HTML elements on the page. The five main values that you can set your position to are Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, and Inherit. Also note that the position property does not cascade meaning that a parent element does not pass its position on to its child. The default position is therefore always static.</p>
          <h5>Static</h5>
          <p class="blogP">Static just means that the element will fall into the flow of other elements on the page normally without any modification. So if the HTML element comes after a div box in the html it will fall in to the flow of the elements after that div box and its position will be determined by the dive box and the size, margin, padding, etc. of the elements around it. Some important things to know about the Static are that it is the default value and is rarely set explicitly because of that.</p>
          <div class="blogImageDiv">
            <img src="./imgs/static.png">
            <p class="blogImgLabel">As you can see in the example below the red div box has not had its position set to anything and therefore defaults to a position: static. It therefore falls into the flow of elements in the wrapper div.</p>
          </div>
          <h6>Sample HTML:</h6>
          <code>
              &lt;html&gt;<br>
              &lt;head&gt;<br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css"&gt;<br>
                &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br>
              &lt;/head&gt;<br>
              &lt;body&gt;<br>
                &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;div id="relDiv"&gt;<br>
                  This div does not have its position set to anything (therefore it defaults to be static).<br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
              &lt;/body&gt;<br>
              &lt;/html&gt;<br>
          </code>
          <h6>Sample CSS:</h6>
          <code>
            #wrapper { <br>
              height: 400px; <br>
              width: 800px; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
            } <br>
            <br>

            #relDiv { <br>
              height: 200px; <br>
              width: 200px; <br>
              background-color: red; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
            }<br>
          </code>
          <h5>Relative</h5>
          <p class="blogP">With this position setting you can alter the location of the element relative to where it would be if its position were set to static.  As you can see with the example below I set it to be top: 30px; and left: 80px; which means that its top will be pushed down 30 pixels and its left side will be pushed 80 pixels to the right of where it would have been positioned if it were static.</p>
          <p class="blogP">One nuance of setting position relative is that the other elements in the flow act like the element with relative position is still in its normal position, not, say 30px down and 80px left.</p>
          <div class="blogImageDiv">
            <img src="./imgs/relative.png">
            <p class="blogImgLabel">The top is pushed down 30 pixels and its left side is pushed 80 pixels to the right of where it would have been positioned if it were static.</p>
          </div>
          <h6>Sample HTML:</h6>
          <code>
                &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;div id="relDiv"&gt;<br>
                  This div has position: relative.<br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
          </code>
          <h6>Sample CSS:</h6>
          <code>
            #relDiv { <br>
              height: 200px; <br>
              width: 200px; <br>
              background-color: red; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
              position: relative; <br>
              top: 30px; <br>
              left: 80px; <br>
            }<br>
          </code>
          <h5>Absolute</h5>
          <p class="blogP">Absolute positioning is an interesting one. It allows you to position your element relative to its closest parent element that also has relative or absolute positioning. If the element has no parent with relative or absolute positioning then it is positioned relative to the html element. So basically you can position the element to the box that it is within but only if that box also has relative or absolute positioning, if it doesn't your box will keep going up the family tree so to speak (referred to as the DOM) until it finds a box that does have relative or absolute positioning.</p>
          <p class="blogP">One thing to be careful with is that elements with absolute positioning are removed from the flow of the elements and are not only not affected by the other elements in the flow but they also no longer affect elements in the flow.  That means that you can't count on an absolute positioned element to push that div that's next to it over to the right, etc.</p>
          <div class="blogImageDiv">
            <img src="./imgs/absolute.png">
            <p class="blogImgLabel">The top is pushed down 500 pixels and its left side is pushed 100 pixels to the right of the closest parent element with absolute or relative position (in this case the html element itself).</p>
          </div>
          <h6>Sample HTML:</h6>
          <code>
                &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;div id="relDiv"&gt;<br>
                  This div has position: absolute.<br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
          </code>
          <h6>Sample CSS:</h6>
          <code>
            #relDiv { <br>
              height: 200px; <br>
              width: 200px; <br>
              background-color: red; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
              position: absolute; <br>
              top: 500px; <br>
              left: 100px; <br>
            }<br>
          </code>
          <h5>Fixed</h5>
          <p class="blogP">Elements with fixed position have their position fixed relative to the browser screen. That means that no matter how much you scroll or expand or contract the browser window the element will remain fixed relative to the browser window. This can create a neat effect when used for things like headers or sidebars but you should use it carefully because it can also take up valuable screen real estate.</p>
          <div class="blogImageDiv">
            <img src="./imgs/fixed1.png">
            <p class="blogImgLabel">Before Scrolling</p>

            <img src="./imgs/fixed2.png">
            <p class="blogImgLabel">After Scrolling.  See how the Red Div Box remains fixed relative to the browser but the top of the outter div box has moved down.</p>
          </div>
          <h6>Sample HTML:</h6>
          <code>
                &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;div id="relDiv"&gt;<br>
                  This div has position: fixed.<br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
          </code>
          <h6>Sample CSS:</h6>
          <code>
            #relDiv { <br>
              height: 200px; <br>
              width: 200px; <br>
              background-color: red; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
              position: fixed; <br>
              top: 0px; <br>
              left: 0px; <br>
            }<br>
          </code>
          <h5>Inherit</h5>
          <p class="blogP">This means that the element will inherit its position setting from its parent element.</p>

        <h3 >Version Control, Git, and GitHub - What it is, what it does, and how it can help you</h4>
        <h6 >October 10, 2014</h6>
        <h5>What is Version Control?</h5>
        <p class="blogP">First, what is version control?  Version control is a genre of software that helps you keep track of the changes you make to your work.  It also helps immensely with collaboration on projects where many people might be editing the same or different parts of a document or different documents in the same project from different places at different times.  So to be clear version control is not a specific piece of software rather it is a type of software.</p>
        <h5>Git and How it helps you keep track of your changes</h5>
        <p class="blogP">Now let's move on to Git.  Git is a very popular version control software (some people call it SCM or source code management software).  So in case you're still confused you can think of this analogy (sorry for those that don't like analogies, I love them) version control software is to Git as Rock Music is to Led Zepplin.  ie Git is just a type of version control software.</p>
        <p class="blogP">OK, so how does Git work.  After installing Git on your local machine (ie your laptop or desktop) you can turn any directory (ie folder) into a Git repository.  All this means is that you are telling Git that you want it to keep an eye on this folder (and the files in it) for you.  Lets say you tell Git to keep an eye on a folder called "Blog Posts" (note that Git can track any type of files not just programming files). Inside this folder you just created a file called "Hiking Trip." Git will notice that you have added a file and automatically track the changes to it. Now let's say you are at a good stopping place and want to save this version of the blog post on Git. You can do that by what is called staging the file which I think of as kind of moving the changes into the frame of the camera and then commiting the changes which is like taking a snapshot of what is in the camera's frame. Git is great because at any point in time you can return to the version of your file captured by any one of these commits.  Another analogy I've seen floating around the web is that a Git commit is like a checkpoint in a video game. If you go further and screw up, you don't have to start over but can instead start from your last commit/checkpoint.</p>
        <p class="blogP">Another topic that I will touch on quickly but not really fully cover is branching.  With Git you can create multiple branches of your project so let's say you are working on a website and you are thinking about adding a feature.  What you would do here is create a branch off of the main trunk (also called the master branch).  In the master branch you would keep your most perfect version of your website and then in your new branch you could start with the same code as the master branch but then edit it to add the new feature.  After testing out the new feature in the branch you could do what is called merging which means you would merge the code from the new branch back into the master branch so that you now only have one branch that incorporates the new feature.  Alternatively, if you didn't like how the feature turned out you could just delete the new branch and continue on with the master branch.</p>
        <h5>Why use GitHub to store your code</h5>
        <p class="blogP">Git is a distributed Version Control System.  This means that if you are working on a team, everyone on that team has a full version of the repository on their local machine (ie laptop). While this is good because it means that the entire source code is stored in multiple places so if one computer crashes there is a backup it could still be more convenient. For example if I commit a change and then want to push it to the group (bascially send this snapshot to everyone) I would have to wait for someone else in the group to be online. Enter GitHub. GitHub is a service that works with Git and will host our source code remotely on one of their servers so that everyone can push and pull committed snapshots to and from the server without anyone else needing to be online. This is super handy. In additon to this core feature, GitHub is a social network where you can publish the source code of your projects and check out other peoples' projects as well.</p>
        <h5>Some sources that I have found helpful in learning about all of this</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>http://git-scm.com/ -- the official Git website.  Really good documentation</li>
          <li>http://gitreal.codeschool.com/ -- pretty good videos with interactive challenges.  The first one is free but after that it costs $30/month.</li>
          <li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) -- always a good place to start.  Has some interesting history about the beginnings of Git.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor">That's all for me today.  Hope this helped!</p>

        <h3 >Cultural Impressions of DBC - Week 1 Thoughts</h4>
        <h6 >October 10, 2014</h6>
        <p class="blogP">Well first of all I think it's going to be a wild ride.  Watching the video with Shereef not only reminded me of how much work it will be but also how much responsibility I have in this process. Hearing him talk or write about the analogy of the restaurant vs. the kitchen and think that it's a great way to approach this experience.  Not only do I think I/ we will learn faster with the kitchen mentality where we all get messy, make things, create the experience that we want to have, but I also think that it will make our lives after DBC much richer because rather than there being a dropoff after DBC this mentality will stay with us.</p>
        <div class="blogImageDiv">
          <img src="./imgs/ratChef.jpeg">
          <p class="blogImgLabel">I guess my computer's mouse will be my helper in the DBC kitchen</p>
        </div>
        <p class="blogP">I think that it will be extremely important to remind myself that I am responsible for learning and taking advantage of the opportunities/ resources that DBC provides.  I think this is one of the places where my expectations have gradually changed and I really like the fact that I am expecting to have so much more agency and responsibility when it comes to my experience at DBC.</p>
        <p class="blogP">I couldn't be more excited to participate in this learning environment and have become increasingly excited as I have been noticing the incremental improvements of my understanding of CLI and git/github this week.  Can't wait to start on html next week!</p>
