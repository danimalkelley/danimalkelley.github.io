# Cultural Impressions of DBC
#### Week 1 Thoughts
#### 10/10/14

Well first of all I think it's going to be a wild ride.  Watching the video with Shereef not only reminded me of how much work it will be but also how much responsibility I have in this process.  I remember hearing him talk or write about the analogy of the restaurant vs. the kitchen and think that it's a great way to approach this experience.  Not only do I think I/ we will learn faster with the kitchen mentality where we all get messy, make things, create the experience that we want to have, but I also think that it will make our lives after DBC much richer because rather than there being a dropoff after DBC this mentality will stay with us.

I think that it will be extremely important for me to remind myself that I am responsible for learning and taking advantage of the opportunities/ resources that DBC provides.  I think this is one of the places where my expectations have gradually changed and I really like the fact that I am expecting to have so much more agency and responsibility when it comes to my experience at DBC.

I couldn't be more excited to participate in this learning environment and have become increasingly excited as I have been noticing the incremental improvements of my understanding of CLI and git/github this week.  Can't wait to start on html next week!
