          <h2>Thinking and Learning Styles</h2>
          <h4>October 25, 2014</h4>
          <h3>Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
          <p>After taking the quiz <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">here</a> I found that I am primarily a concrete random thinker with some tendancies towards abstract random. So, what does that all mean. Basically as I understand it from reading <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a> the random part means that I like to do things in chunks rather than in a sequence and the concrete part means that I like to deal with sensory input although abstract random was my second highest. Before delving in to plans based on this, I would like to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how well I feel like this articulated how I like to learn.</p>
          <p>These insights are first helpful by just acknowledging what comes easily to me and what I need to work on a list of which can be found <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a>. Thus far the biggest struggle for me has been getting myself to go back to things that I have already finished to refactor them and improve them. Once I do this, however, I find it to be extremely helpful for my learning process. I think one strategy going forward will be to pick the challenge that I struggled with the most during a given week and do it again. I did this with the website challenge in week 2 and found it super beneficial in solidifying my grasp of css positioning.</p>

          <h3>Fixed vs. Growth Mindset</h3>
          <p>This notion really resonated with me when I first read it before starting Phase 0. I think that in the past I have often favored the fixed mindset and even today I find myself falling back into it. For me at this point I think the most effective tool for moving towards a growth mindset is to acknowledge when I am exhibiting behavior of a fixed mindset (such as trying to look like I know am knowledgable rather than being as honest as possible so that I can learn as much as possible) I should acknowledge it. Once I acknowledge it, I find it much easier to adjust my mindset to be more growth oriented.</p>
