          <h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
          <h4>November 27, 2014</h4>
          <p>A couple of weeks ago I was about to leave on a long trip and my mother suggested that I go visit my grandmother in Michigan before leaving the country. I said that I would do that and began making arrangements.  When I told my mom that I would fly back on Sunday before leaving again on Tuesday, she got mad because she said she had been hoping to spend the weekend with me. I felt a bit angry because I felt like I was being treated like a commodity instead of a person. <a href="c8-conflict.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>Javascript Objects compared with Ruby Hashes</h2>
          <h4>November 24, 2014</h4>
          <p>Today I'm going to write a little about the differences I see between Objects in Javascript and Hashes in Ruby. As I've discussed in a previous post Ruby Hashes are a data structure which is made up of one or many key and value pairs. The key is the first piece of information and the second is the value corresponding to that key. These are great when you want to store information with labels.  See the code below for an example of a hash in Ruby with the name daniel_info. Note in the example that hashes can have arrays and other hashes nested within them. Also notice the symbol notation used for some of the keys in the hash. <a href="t7-JavaScript.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
          <h4>November 19, 2014</h4>
          <p>Stereotype threat is a phenomenon researched by Claude Steele in which an individual underperforming in an activity in which their identity is stereotyped to underperform. Dr. Steele's main research in this topic has to do with the underperformance of women in mathematical exams due to the stereotype that women underperform in that area and the underperformance of minorities in academic settings due to stereotypes to that effect. <a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <p>In this blog post I will discuss Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas, the three similar but distinct ways that Ruby allows you to pass commands to a method akin to the way you might pass arguments to a method. These features are known as closures in Computer Science. <a href="t6-oop-concepts.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>Pair Programming and Feedback</h2>
          <h4>November 6, 2014</h4>
          <p>Pair programming is an integral part of Dev Bootcamp and Phase 0 is no exception. Each week I've paired at least twice with other students and have come to really enjoy and appreciate the experience. At first I was most frusterated by the hassle of scheduling the pairing sessions and getting everything to work on a technical level (google+ hangouts, stypi, etc.). As I have progessed into Phase 0 and the challenges and concepts have become trickier I have come to value these pair sessions more and more. One aspect that I find particularly helpful is the way a second perspective pulls me out of the tunnel vision I sometimes get when approaching a problem. <a href="c5-feedback.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>Lack of Diversity in the Tech Industry and What To Do About It</h2>
          <h4>October 29, 2014</h4>
          <p>One of the largest issues facing the tech industry these days seems to be a lack of diversity both in terms of ethnicity and gender. While these are hardly new problems for the tech industry it does seem that they are starting to get some publicity and that the industry has begun to recognize that there is a problem and something needs to be done about it. <a href="c4-tech-issues.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>Thinking and Learning Styles</h2>
          <h4>October 25, 2014</h4>
          <p>After taking the quiz <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">here</a> I found that I am primarily a concrete random thinker with some tendancies towards abstract random. So, what does that all mean. Basically as I understand it from reading <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a> the random part means that I like to do things in chunks rather than in a sequence and the concrete part means that I like to deal with sensory input although abstract random was my second highest. <a href="c3_thinking-style.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes in Ruby</h2>
          <h4>October 25, 2014</h4>
          <p>First I'll talk a bit about arrays and then I'll get into hashes.  Basically arrays are numbered lists where each number is associated with a slot that acts like a variable. Each slot can be assigned a value such as an integer, a string, a float, etc. Below is a simple example of an array. <a href="t3-arrays-hashes.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>An Introduction to Pair Programming</h2>
          <h4>October 20, 2014</h4>
          <p>Pair programming is a technique for programming in which software developers work in pairs on the same code at the same time. Pair programming can be useful by minimizing errors by having a second pair of eyes on the code. It can also be a useful tool to spread knowledge from a more senior developer to a junior or newer member of the team. <a href=pair-programming-intro.html>Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>CSS Positioning: An Introduction</h2>
          <h4>October 17, 2014</h4>
          <p>The positioning property in CSS, not surprisingly, helps you position your HTML elements on the page. The five main values that you can set your position to are Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, and Inherit. Also note that the position property does not cascade meaning that a parent element does not pass its position on to its child. The default position is therefore always static. <a href="t2-css-design.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>Version Control, Git, and GitHub - What it is, what it does, and how it can help you</h2>
          <h4>October 10, 2014</h4>
          <p>First, what is version control?  Version control is a genre of software that helps you keep track of the changes you make to your work.  It also helps immensely with collaboration on projects where many people might be editing the same or different parts of a document or different documents in the same project from different places at different times.  So to be clear version control is not a specific piece of software rather it is a type of software. <a href="t1-git-blog.html">Read more.</a></p>

          <h2>Cultural Impressions of DBC - Week 1 Thoughts</h2>
          <h4>October 10, 2014</h4>
          <p>Well first of all I think it's going to be a wild ride.  Watching the video with Shereef not only reminded me of how much work it will be but also how much responsibility I have in this process. Hearing him talk or write about the analogy of the restaurant vs. the kitchen and think that it's a great way to approach this experience.  Not only do I think I/ we will learn faster with the kitchen mentality where we all get messy, make things, create the experience that we want to have, but I also think that it will make our lives after DBC much richer because rather than there being a dropoff after DBC this mentality will stay with us. <a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">Read more.</a></p>
