          <h2>CSS Positioning: An Introduction</h2>
          <h4>October 17, 2014</h4>
          <h3>How does CSS Spacing work?</h3>
          <p>The positioning property in CSS, not surprisingly, helps you position your HTML elements on the page. The five main values that you can set your position to are Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, and Inherit. Also note that the position property does not cascade meaning that a parent element does not pass its position on to its child. The default position is therefore always static.</p>
          <h3>Static</h3>
          <p>Static just means that the element will fall into the flow of other elements on the page normally without any modification. So if the HTML element comes after a div box in the html it will fall in to the flow of the elements after that div box and its position will be determined by the dive box and the size, margin, padding, etc. of the elements around it. Some important things to know about the Static are that it is the default value and is rarely set explicitly because of that.</p>

            <h6>As you can see in the example below the red div box has not had its position set to anything and therefore defaults to a position: static. It therefore falls into the flow of elements in the wrapper div.</h6>
          </div>

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
            &lt;html&gt;<br>
              &lt;head&gt;<br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css"&gt;<br>
                &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br>
              &lt;/head&gt;<br>
              &lt;body&gt;<br>
                &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;div id="relDiv"&gt;<br>
                  This div does not have its position set to anything (therefore it defaults to be static).<br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
              &lt;/body&gt;<br>
              &lt;/html&gt;<br>
          </pre>

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
            #wrapper { <br>
              height: 400px; <br>
              width: 800px; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
            } <br>
            <br>

            #relDiv { <br>
              height: 200px; <br>
              width: 200px; <br>
              background-color: red; <br>
              border: 2px black solid;
          </pre>

          <div class="blogArticleImage">

            <h6>As you can see in the example below the red div box has not had its position set to anything and therefore defaults to a position: static. It therefore falls into the flow of elements in the wrapper div.</h6>
          </div>

          <h3>Relative</h3>
          <p>With this position setting you can alter the location of the element relative to where it would be if its position were set to static.  As you can see with the example below I set it to be top: 30px; and left: 80px; which means that its top will be pushed down 30 pixels and its left side will be pushed 80 pixels to the right of where it would have been positioned if it were static.</p>
          <p>One nuance of setting position relative is that the other elements in the flow act like the element with relative position is still in its normal position, not, say 30px down and 80px left.</p>

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
            &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;div id="relDiv"&gt;<br>
                  This div has position: relative.<br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
          </pre>

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
            #relDiv { <br>
              height: 200px; <br>
              width: 200px; <br>
              background-color: red; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
              position: relative; <br>
              top: 30px; <br>
              left: 80px; <br>
            }
          </pre>

          <div class="blogArticleImage">
            <img src="../imgs/relative.png">
            <h6>The top is pushed down 30 pixels and its left side is pushed 80 pixels to the right of where it would have been positioned if it were static.</h6>
          </div>

          <h3>Absolute</h3>
          <p>Absolute positioning is an interesting one. It allows you to position your element relative to its closest parent element that also has relative or absolute positioning. If the element has no parent with relative or absolute positioning then it is positioned relative to the html element. So basically you can position the element to the box that it is within but only if that box also has relative or absolute positioning, if it doesn't your box will keep going up the family tree so to speak (referred to as the DOM) until it finds a box that does have relative or absolute positioning.</p>
          <p>One thing to be careful with is that elements with absolute positioning are removed from the flow of the elements and are not only not affected by the other elements in the flow but they also no longer affect elements in the flow.  That means that you can't count on an absolute positioned element to push that div that's next to it over to the right, etc.</p>

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
            &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;div id="relDiv"&gt;<br>
                  This div has position: absolute.<br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
          </pre>

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
            #relDiv { <br>
              height: 200px; <br>
              width: 200px; <br>
              background-color: red; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
              position: absolute; <br>
              top: 500px; <br>
              left: 100px; <br>
            }
          </pre>

          <div class="blogArticleImage">
            <img src="../imgs/absolute.png">
            <h6>The top is pushed down 500 pixels and its left side is pushed 100 pixels to the right of the closest parent element with absolute or relative position (in this case the html element itself).</h6>
          </div>

          <h3>Fixed</h3>
          <p>Elements with fixed position have their position fixed relative to the browser screen. That means that no matter how much you scroll or expand or contract the browser window the element will remain fixed relative to the browser window. This can create a neat effect when used for things like headers or sidebars but you should use it carefully because it can also take up valuable screen real estate.</p>

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
            &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;div id="relDiv"&gt;<br>
                  This div has position: fixed.<br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
          </pre>

          <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
            #relDiv { <br>
              height: 200px; <br>
              width: 200px; <br>
              background-color: red; <br>
              border: 2px black solid; <br>
              position: fixed; <br>
              top: 0px; <br>
              left: 0px; <br>
            }
          </pre>

          <div class="blogArticleImage">
            <img src="../imgs/fixed1.png">
            <h6>Before scrolling</h6>
            <img src="../imgs/fixed2.png">
            <h6>After Scrolling.  See how the Red Div Box remains fixed relative to the browser but the top of the outter div box has moved down.</h6>
          </div>

          <h3>Inherit</h3>
          <p>This means that the element will inherit its position setting from its parent element.</p>
