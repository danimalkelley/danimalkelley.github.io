          <h2>Tips for Asking Great Questions</h2>
          <h4>December 5, 2014</h4>
          <p>In this post I'll talk about how to write great code-related questions with sites like StackOverflow specifically in mind. Before I get into things any further I'd also like to point out some posts that have already dealt with this very topic that I found useful. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140709094611/http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx">Jon Skeet on Writing the Perfect Question</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">Stackoverflow's suggestions</a>, and the more lengthy <a href="http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a> by Eric Steven Raymond.</p>
          <p>Now, for my take on things. The three biggest things to keep in mind when asking questions are: Have I done everything I can do to answer this question on my own? How can I make this question easy and enjoyable to answer? and Have I included a useful and working code sample?</p>
          <h3>Have I done everything I can do to answer this question on my own?</h3>
          <p>People on StackOverflow and similar sites are there to help you with their expertise, not to do your work for you. Therefore do them the courtesy of researching your own problem thoroughly before posting it as a new question. Afterall, the greatest power of a place like StackOverflow is not that you can ask whatever question you want but that you can browse the myriad questions and answers that came before you. With this powerful resource you can very often answer your own question without even posting it.</p>
          <h3>How can I make this question easy and enjoyable to answer?</h3>
          <p>So once you have done your research and have decided that you still need to ask your question, you should start writing your question in such a way that it's easy and enjoyable to answer--after all you want someone to answer it, right? First things first, make sure your title is concise, readable, and descriptive. Most people seem to suggest phrasing it as an actual question as well. If you are having trouble writing a good title you can always write the body of the question and then return to the title afterwards when you might have a better idea of how to summarize things. When writing the body of the question it is useful to write a summary and then get into the meat of things.  Some information that is good to provide includes, what languages, API's etc. you are using, what the macro goal of your code is, what the micro goal of your problematic code is, what is happening vs. what you are expecting to happen, what resources you have already researched and why they have or haven't helped, and a code sample. While working on this it might seem like it is taking a long time but remember how much time you are potentially saving yourself, and more importantly, think of how much time and energy you are saving that incredibly nice person on the other end of the internet who is helping answer your question.</p>
          <h3>Have I included a useful and working code sample?</h3>
          <p>Some tips for including a useful code sample:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Include only what you need to to convey the problem and be careful when submitting your employer's code</li>
            <li>Make sure it runs at least as much as you expect it to</li>
            <li>Include any require statements</li>
            <li>If you think it helps add a link to a <a href="jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle</a> with your code</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Sidenote:</h3>
          <p>Isn't it so cool that there is a huge community of people out there helping one another just for the sake of helping others!?</p>
