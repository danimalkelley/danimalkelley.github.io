          <h2>Pair Programming and Feedback</h2>
          <h4>November 6, 2014</h4>
          <p>Pair programming is an integral part of Dev Bootcamp and Phase 0 is no exception. Each week I've paired at least twice with other students and have come to really enjoy and appreciate the experience. At first I was most frusterated by the hassle of scheduling the pairing sessions and getting everything to work on a technical level (google+ hangouts, stypi, etc.). As I have progessed into Phase 0 and the challenges and concepts have become trickier I have come to value these pair sessions more and more. One aspect that I find particularly helpful is the way a second perspective pulls me out of the tunnel vision I sometimes get when approaching a problem.  More than once in a pairing session I have felt absolutely certain that the problem should be approached one way and then been pleasantly surprised by my pair's solution that was more elegent, more robust, or just easier. Another thing I like to do is to pair on a challenge that I have already done by myself. This gives me the opportunity to revisit the problem with someone else to either validate my original approach or to discover that there was a better way to do it. Finally, pairing has forced me to actually talk about the abstract concepts I am learning about and, in doing so, has helped me understand them much, much better.</p>
          <p>A second perk to pairing is recieving feedback from your pair. While I definitely feel a bit anxious and hopeful that people have enjoyed working with me, more than anything I hope that my pairs have noticed things that I can improve upon and have pointed those things out. While positive feedback makes you feel warm and fuzzy, the most useful feedback highlights a weak point in an insightful manner.</p>
          <p>The feedback I've recieved thus far has been OK. It is very nice but is often a bit short and not as specific as it could be. As I reflect on this I know that I am guilty of providing similarly deficient feedback. One reason for my own lackluster feedback, is timing. Until now I have tried to write and submit my feedback immediately after finishing my pairing session. As a result I am usually a bit tired from the pairing session itself and tend to want to just get this seemingly-beurocratic step over with. In the future I will jot a couple of notes down about the session while it is fresh in my head, take a break, and then come back and write more thoughtful and verbose feedback while referencing my notes. For me the hardest part about giving good feedback is honing in on something specific that I think my pair could improve upon.  This is something that I will focus on in future pairing sessions as I think it is the most difficult but most important aspect of feedback.</p>
          <p>Overall, pairing and recieving feedback has been very helpful in my development as a programmer because it provides a short and tight feedback cycle that allows me to improve my skills and process on a tight schedule.</p>
