          <h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
          <h4>November 27, 2014</h4>
          <p>
            A couple of weeks ago I was about to leave on a long trip and my mother suggested that I go visit my grandmother in Michigan before leaving the country. I said that I would do that and began making arrangements.  When I told my mom that I would fly back on Sunday before leaving again on Tuesday, she got mad because she said she had been hoping to spend the weekend with me. I felt a bit angry because I felt like I was being treated like a commodity instead of a person. I handled the conflict by telling my mom this and she apologized for getting mad and explained that she was just anxious because she was going to miss me while I was on my trip out of the country. I said I understood this and that I would look into changing the flight so that I got back on Saturday so I could spend a bit more time with her and my dad before leaving.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think talking about how we both felt helped immensely in this case as it helped us both see where the other person was coming from and also encouraged us both to act more rationally and civilly with one another.
            If I could go back I think I would try to empathize with my mother and anticipate that she might want to spend time with me before I left on my trip and take that into account when I was making my plans.
