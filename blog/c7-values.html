          <h2>Values and Combating Stereotype Threat</h2>
          <h4>November 25, 2014</h4>
          <p>
            This week Dev Bootcamp has asked us to perform some exercises related to our Values and Combating Stereotype Threat. Below are the prompts and my responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prompt: When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?
          </p>
          <p>
            Response:
            Challenge, Helping others, Knowledge, Honesty, Nature, and Growth
          </p>
          <p>
            Prompt: Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Response:
            Challenges and challenging task are important to my happiness and sense of accomplishment. What I find specifically exhilarating about challenges is the difference between the beginning of a challenge (whether I am learning to be a web developer, climbing a mountain, or working on a math problem) when the task at hand seems impossibly difficult and the moment somewhere in the middle of the task when I can see a bit of my progress and start to feel like it is actually possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prompt: Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:
            In general, I try to live up to these values:
            Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
          </p>
          <p>
            Response:
            Challenge: 4
            Helping others: 4
            Knowledge: 5
            Honesty: 5
            Nature: 4
            Growth: 5
          </p>
          <p>
            Prompt: What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?
          </p>
          <p>
            Response:
            Yesterday a fellow DBC'er asked me for advice on researching Driver Test Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prompt: Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?
          </p>
          <p>
            Response:
            I definitely think recognizing when I feel stereotype threat can help me mitigate its effects. Recognizing that it is happening will allow me to sort of look it in the face and move past it and hopefully prevent it from distracting me further.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prompt: Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?
          </p>
          <p>
            Response:
            If I am feeling down at DBC my first move will be to get some exercise. For me, exercise is a borderline panacea which both makes me feel better and clears my head so that I can think about whatever is bothering me in a constructive way. I also think that talking about things with my friends inside and outside DBC will be a useful tool.
