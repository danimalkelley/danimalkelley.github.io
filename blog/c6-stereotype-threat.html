          <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
          <h4>November 19, 2014</h4>
          <p>Stereotype threat is a phenominon researched by Claude Steele in which an individual underperforming in an activity in which their identity is stereotyped to underperform. Dr. Steele's main research in this topic has to do with the underperformance of women in mathematical exams due to the stereotype that women underperform in that area and the underperformance of minorities in academic settings due to stereotypes to that effect.</p>
          <p>Explained in greater length in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">here</a> Dr. Steele describes his research showing that when he gave a math test to math majors at the University of Michigan women significantly underperformed compared to their male counterparts.  When his research team prefaced the exam with a statement saying that woman and men performed the same on this particular test, however, woman and men performed the same on the test.</p>
          <p>Later in the talk, Steele moved on to discuss a manifestation of Stereotype threat that surprising to me. The study involved looking at how a white student placed chairs for a discussion based on the topic of the conversation (love or racial profiling) and whether it would be with white students or black students. The basic upshot of the findings was that the chairs were placed close together in all of the situations except for discussing racial profiling with black students. More interesting, however, was the fact that the students that were determined to be the least prejudiced against blacks placed the chairs with the greatest distance leading Steele to conclude that it was these unprejudiced students that stood to lose the most from their stereotype threat--being seen as racist while discussing racial profiling with black students.</p>
          <p>This study led me to think about situations in which I have experienced Stereotype Threat. As a white male I have led a pretty privaledged life and have been lucky to not percieve many negative stereotypes about myself or my identities. That being said I can think of many times in which I have become self aware when discussing discrimination (largely perpetrated by white men) against others. In these discussions or writings, I feel self-conious and distracted to the point that it detracts from my ability to express myself thoughtfully and clearly because my main objective is to be percieved as not prejudiced. In future situations I will do my best to confront this fear and stereotype and be more aware of when it arises and how I react to it. This exercise has further allowed me to empathize with others who might experience this phenominon in a more harmful way than I have and I will work harder to make situations in which this might arise more comfortable for those at risk to it.</p>
