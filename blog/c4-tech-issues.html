          <h2>Lack of Diversity in the Tech Industry and What To Do About It</h2>
          <h4>October 29, 2014</h4>
          <p>One of the largest issues facing the tech industry these days seems to be a lack of diversity both in terms of ethnicity and gender. While these are hardly new problems for the tech industry it does seem that they are starting to get some publicity and that the industry has begun to recognize that there is a problem and something needs to be done about it.</p>
          <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
          <p>Both women and minorities (especially blacks and hispanics) are severely underrepresented in the tech industry, especially so in technical and leadership roles. There are myriad statistics to back this up readily available with a quick google search so I'll be brief and just say that from most of my reading the percentage of tech employees that are women is around 25% and under 5% for both blacks and hispanics.</p>
          <h3>Why is this a problem?</h3>
          <p>To start with, a more diverse workforce would equip the industry with more diverse perspectives, experiences, etc. and would thus help the industry produce better products that speak to a larger range of the population. Furthermore, after reading more about this issue it became clear that a large reason this lack of diversity exists is due to a hostile culture (especially towards women). This is a problem because, well, hostile cultures are bad.</p>
          <p>So what can we do to remedy this problem? One idea is to increase the number of women and minorities that study STEM fields in school. Some strategies to do this would be to increase the number of female and minority mentors to these students and to increase the number of scholarships available to these students (maybe tech companies could sponsor these scholarships, as well). Programming bootcamps, such as Dev Bootcamp (shameless plug) are also working to fill this gap by working with programs like Lenovo scholars.</p>
          <p>Another solution that I would recommend is trying to enact a cultural shift. Leaders in the tech industry must recognize their power and responsibility and make it a priority to show everyone that diversity is good for the industry and that the sometimes pervasive macho attitudes are not cool or acceptible. This will take time and will not be easy but, like I think would eventually win out over the current culture.</p>
