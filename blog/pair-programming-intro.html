          <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
          <h4>October 20, 2014</h4>
          <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
          <p>Pair programming is a technique for programming in which software developers work in pairs on the same code at the same time. Pair programming can be useful by minimizing errors by having a second pair of eyes on the code. It can also be a useful tool to spread knowledge from a more senior developer to a junior or newer member of the team.</p>

          <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
          <p>Pair Programming, as far as I can tell (I'm only in week 3) is integral aspect to DBC. This makes a lot of sense to me because DBC emphasizes learning from your peers and pairing is a great way to do this. Furthermore, DBC stresses the process of teaching to cement your understanding of a concept--which defintiely happens in pairing sessions.  DBC also uses pairing sessions as a way to build engineering empathy within its Boots.</p>

          <h3>Comparison of Driver and Navigator Roles</h3>
          <p>I see the role of the Navigator as the teammate who keeps a higher level view of the project or problem and might even keep an eye on what is coming up ahead. They can also perform research on a topic if the driver has stuff to work on. For remote pairing sessions the navigator can also be in charge of running the code on their location machine periodically. I see the driver as the person who is more in the trenches of the code working on the syntax and just putting everything down in the Text Editor. If stuck with something the driver can also just test some ideas out while the navigator reads about the issue online.</p>
